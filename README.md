# Object Counting in an Image

This project implements an image processing pipeline to count the number of distinct objects in a given image.
It leverages computer vision techniques such as thresholding, contour detection, and morphological operations.

Features:

- Automatic detection and counting of objects in images
- Preprocessing with grayscale conversion and noise removal
- Binary thresholding and contour detection
- Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes or labels
- Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)

Technologies Used:

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
